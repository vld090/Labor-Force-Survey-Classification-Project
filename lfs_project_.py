# **Introduction to the dataset**
## **1. Introduction to the Problem and Dataset**
This project aims to predict employment status using demographic and survey data. The dataset used is from the **Labor Force Survey (LFS) - April 2016**, which contains detailed employment-related attributes of individuals.

### **Target Task**
The primary task is **classification**, where we predict an individual's **employment status** based on their:
* age;
* marital status;
* education level;
* and graduate status (technical or vocational).

## **2. Dataset Description**

### **Brief Description**
The dataset contains informaiton on individuals from the **Labor Force Survey (LFS) - April 2016**, a nationwide quarterly household survey aimed at estimating employment, unemployment, and underemployment levels in the Philippines

### **Data Collection Process**
- Conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) as part of monitoring the national labor force.
- Baased on the 2013 Master Sample Design - a randomized representative sample.
- Data was coillected via face-to-face interviews using structured survey forms.
- **Sampling Size:** Approximately 42,768 households nationwide
- **Response Rate:** 95.7%

### **Implications of the Data Collection Method**
- **Sampling Bias:** May not capture seasonal employment trends
- **Self-Reporting issues:** Employment status and income-related responses may be affected by recall bias.

### **Dataset Structure**
- Each row represents one (1) respondent.
- Each column represents a specific demographic, educational, or employment-related feature.
- **Number of Instances:** 180862
- **Number of Features:** 50

### **Feature Descriptions (Based on Documentation)**
The dataset contains the following features:
- **Region** – Geographic region of the respondent (17 administrative regions)  
- **Province** – Province of residence  
- **Household_ID** – Unique identifier for a household  
- **Sex** – Gender of the respondent (1=Male, 2=Female)  
- **Age** – Age in years (15+ years for employment analysis)  
- **Marital_Status** – Marital status (e.g., Single, Married, Widowed)  
- **Education_Level** – Highest grade completed  
- **Currently_Schooling** – Whether the respondent is currently enrolled in school  
- **Work_Indicator** – Employment status (1=Employed, 2=Unemployed, 3=Not in labor force)  
- **Job_Indicator** – Whether the respondent has a current job  
- **Primary_Occupation** – The respondent's primary job classification  
- **Business_Type** – Type of business or industry of employment  
- **Employment_Nature** – Type of employment (e.g., Permanent, Temporary, Seasonal)  
- **Normal_Work_Hours** – Usual working hours per day  
- **Total_Hours_Worked** – Total hours worked in the past week  
- **Looking_Additional_Work** – Whether the respondent is seeking additional work  
- **First_Time_Work** – Whether this is the respondent's first job  
- **Worker_Class** – Classification of worker (e.g., Self-employed, Private, Government)  
- **Daily_Pay** – Basic daily earnings  
- **Employment_Status** – **Target variable** (Employment classification)

Hyperparameter tuning played a crucial role in improving model performance, especially in handling difficult instances:

* Linear SVM: Increasing C to 1.0 allowed the model to make better trade-offs between margin width and classification accuracy, reducing errors in predicting 'Employed' individuals at the cost of slightly misclassifying 'Not Employed' cases.

* RBF SVM: A lower C (0.1) with a high Gamma (1.0) helped the model better capture complex decision boundaries, leading to improved recall and precision for both classes.

Overall, the RBF SVM outperformed the Linear SVM in both scenarios, demonstrating its ability to model more complex relationships in the data. The full training data improved stability and further enhanced accuracy.

"""## **10. Insights and Conclusions**

In this classification task, three different machine learning models were implemented: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN). Upon evaluation, KNN almost completely outperformed both the Nueral Network and SVM, while the SVM performed worse than the other two. This ranking can be attributed to various factors related to model characteristics, hyperparameter tuning, and dataset features.

1. **KNN** *(~79.31% accuracy)*

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved the highest accuracy among the three models, with a performance of approximately 79.31%. This result can be attributed to its simplicity, non-parametric nature, and ability to adapt well to the structure of the data without making strong assumptions. KNN is particularly effective when the dataset is well-distributed and features are scaled properly, as distance-based metrics drive its predictions. Compared to SVM and Neural Networks, KNN requires minimal training time, making it more computationally efficient in that phase. However, KNN can become expensive during inference and may struggle with very large datasets or high-dimensional spaces.

2. **NN** *(~79.16% accuracy)*

The Neural Network outperformed SVM, and is almost as efficient with KNN. While deep learning models are powerful, they require extensive hyperparameter tuning, sufficient training data, and an optimize learning rate to perform at their best. In this case, the NN likely benefited from its nature in which it is able to capture non-linear relationships in the data. This makes it more effective than SVM. However, issues such as overfitting, gradient descent fluctuations, and weight initialization may have prevented it from outright outperforming the other two models. Additionally, neural networks require more computational power and time for training, making them more exhausting than other models.

***It is also worth noting that, due to the stochastic nature of training, the produced evaluations and accuracies may fluctuate.***

3. **SVM** *(~78.74% accuracy)*

**Initial Model Training**

Key Observations (`Linear SVM`):
* High recall for Employed (96%) but low recall for Not Employed (54%), meaning it misclassifies many Not Employed individuals as Employed.
* The decision boundary is too simple (linear), which struggles to capture the complex relationships in employment data.
* Thus, we can infer that the Linear SVM is **underfitting**.

Key Observations (`RBF SVM`):
* More balanced recall (69% for Not Employed, 93% for Employed).
* The model is more flexible and captures complex patterns better.
* False positives and false negatives are lower compared to Linear SVM, meaning it generalizes better.
* Thus, we can infer that RBF SVM is not overfitting, but **well-fitted**.


When it comes to intial model training, RBF SVM is better at correctly identifying Not Employed individuals (69% recall vs. 54%). On the otherhand, Linear SVM is biased towards predicting "Employed," leading to many false positives (FP = 9,962). RBF provides a more balanced classification, resulting in higher overall accuracy (78.35% vs. 70.77%).

**Conclusion**

As such, KNN, barely outperformed NN, and outperformed SVM,  due to its ability to classify based on local similarity, making it an effective option for the LFS dataset. The NN, while more powerful in theory, required extensive tuning and still faced training challenges that may have limited its performance. SVM, on the other hand, struggled with the dataset's complexity and scalability issues, leading to it exhibiting the lowest performacne amongst the three. These findings highlight the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics. Future improvements, such as better feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and data preprocessing, could further improve these results and produce better model performance.
